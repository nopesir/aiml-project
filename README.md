## Abstract

Self-driving vehicles have spread dramatically over the
last few years. ADAS control system would have to de-
termine steering wheel angle, brakes and acceleration in
any driving environment. The navigation technology in au-
tonomous vehicles is an artificial intelligence application
which remains partially unsolved and has been significantly
explored by the automotive and technological industries.
Many image processing and computer vision techniques al-
low significant improvements on such recent technologies.
In recent years, autonomous driving algorithms, using low-
cost vehicle-mounted cameras, have attracted increasing
endeavors from both academia and industry. There are mul-
tiple fronts to these endeavors, including object detection on
roads, 3-D reconstruction etc., but in this work we focus on
a cameras-based model that directly maps raw input images
to steering angles using deep networks. This represents a
nascent research topic in computer vision.
